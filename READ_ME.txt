To run task 1-4 in the terminal you need to open the task folders on thir own in Visual Studio Code,
ie: the task 1 or task 2 folders not the 103.1-1 folder,
and you need to open Visual Studio Code through a developer terminal,
ie:Developer PowerShell for VS 2019 or Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019,
